# TLVulkanRenderer
A simple Vulkan-based renderer for my [master thesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOAv2D23j74bExjP2MCMmDOQPquy9ywhBTW-tgU2QXA/edit?usp=sharing) on real-time transparency.

The renderer will be a rasterizer the implements [phenomenological transparency](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/TransparencyI3D16/McGuire2016Transparency.pdf) to demonstrate how the GPU could map well to this algorithm for real-time transparency.

This project also documents my learning progress with Vulkan and GPU programming.

# Update Oct 14, 2016

Finished base rasterizer code to render a triangle.
